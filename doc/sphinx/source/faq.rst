How to get help or report an issue ?
------------------------------------

.. There is no mailing list or forum actually, so you can either contact me or fill an issue on Github.

.. If you want to **discuss or ask questions on Patro**, you can subscribe and post messages on the
.. **Patro User** mailing list.
.. 
.. There is actually three lists running on Google Groups (*):
.. 
.. `User List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/Patro-user>`_
..   List for Patro users
.. `Announce List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/Patro-announce>`_
..   List for announcements regarding Patro releases and development
.. `Devel List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/Patro-devel>`_
..   List for developers of Patro
.. 
.. **If you encounter an issue, please fill an issue** on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/Patro/issues>`_.
.. 
.. (*) Despite Google Groups has many drawbacks, I don't have actually enough resources to run GNU Mailman or
.. Discourse on my own IT infrastructure.
