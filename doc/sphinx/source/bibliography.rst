Geometry Engine

* `CGAL Computational Geometry Algorithms Library <http://www.cgal.org>`_
* `Open Cascade Framework <https://www.opencascade.com>`_ an open-source software development platform for 3D CAD, CAM, CAE, etc.

    Shapely is a BSD-licensed Python package for manipulation and analysis of planar geometric
    objects.  It is based on the widely deployed **GEOS** (the engine of PostGIS) and `JTS
    <https://locationtech.github.io/jts>`_ (from which GEOS is ported) libraries.  Shapely is not
    concerned with data formats or coordinate systems, but can be readily integrated with packages
    that are.

* `GEOS <http://trac.osgeo.org/geos>`_

  * Geometries: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection
  * Predicates: Intersects, Touches, Disjoint, Crosses, Within, Contains, Overlaps, Equals, Covers
  * Operations: Union, Distance, Intersection, Symmetric Difference, Convex Hull, Envelope, Buffer, Simplify, Polygon Assembly, Valid, Area, Length,
  * Prepared geometries (pre-spatially indexed)
  * STR spatial index
  * C and C++ API (C API gives long term ABI stability)
  * Thread safe (using the reentrant API)
