Geometry Engine
---------------

* `CGAL Computational Geometry Algorithms Library <http://www.cgal.org>`_

* `Open Cascade Framework <https://www.opencascade.com>`_ an open-source software development
  platform for 3D CAD, CAM, CAE, etc.

* `lib2geom <https://gitlab.com/inkscape/lib2geom>`_ is a C++ 2D geometry library geared towards
  robust processing of computational geometry data associated with vector graphics. The primary
  design consideration is ease of use and clarity. It is dual-licensed under LGPL 2.1 and MPL 1.1.
  The library is descended from a set of geometric routines present in Inkscape, a vector graphics
  editor based around the Scalable Vector Graphics format, the most widespread vector graphics
  interchange format on the Web and a W3C Recommendation. Due to this legacy, not all parts of the
  API form a coherent whole (yet).

* `David Eberly Geometric Tools web site <https://www.geometrictools.com/index.html>`_

* `Clipper <http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php>`_ an open source library for clipping and
  offsetting lines and polygons.  The Clipper library performs line & polygon clipping -
  intersection, union, difference & exclusive-or, and line & polygon offsetting. The library is
  based on Vatti's clipping algorithm.  Licensed under Boost Software License.  Authored by Angus
  Johnson in 2014.

* `Shapely <https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely>`_ is a BSD-licensed Python package for
  manipulation and analysis of planar geometric objects.  It is based on the widely deployed
  **GEOS** (the engine of PostGIS) and `JTS <https://locationtech.github.io/jts>`_ (from which GEOS
  is ported) libraries.  Shapely is not concerned with data formats or coordinate systems, but can
  be readily integrated with packages that are.

  * `Shapely Documentaion <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_

* `GEOS <http://trac.osgeo.org/geos>`_

  * Geometries: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection
  * Predicates: Intersects, Touches, Disjoint, Crosses, Within, Contains, Overlaps, Equals, Covers
  * Operations: Union, Distance, Intersection, Symmetric Difference, Convex Hull, Envelope, Buffer, Simplify, Polygon Assembly, Valid, Area, Length,
  * Prepared geometries (pre-spatially indexed)
  * STR spatial index
  * C and C++ API (C API gives long term ABI stability)
  * Thread safe (using the reentrant API)

JavaScript Vector Graphics Libraries
------------------------------------

* `Paper.js <http://paperjs.org>`_ is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs
  on top of the HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of
  powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, all neatly
  wrapped up in a well designed, consistent and clean programming interface.

  * `Example <http://paperjs.org/examples/>`_
  * `Reference Manual <http://paperjs.org/reference/global/>`_
  * `Source code <https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js>`_ 10k stars
  * http://assets.paperjs.org/boolean
  * `Revamp Boolean Operations #761 <https://github.com/paperjs/paper.js/issues/761>`_



.. `Two.js <https://two.js.org>`_ is a two-dimensional drawing api geared towards modern web
   browsers. It is renderer agnostic enabling the same api to draw in multiple contexts: svg,
   canvas, and webgl.
