Introduction: Stitches are divided into six classes which are identified by the first digit of three
  digit numerals. Each class is divided into several types which are identified by the second and
  third digit.

Classes:

  Stitch Class 100:
    name: Single Thread Chain Stitches

    description: This class of stitch (Types 101 through 105) is formed with one or more needle
      threads and requires interlooping. A loop (or loops) of thread(s) shall be passed through the
      material and be secured by interlooping with succeeding loop or loops, after they are passed
      through the material, to form a stitch.

    stitches:

      101:
        name: Single Thread Chain Stitches
        number_of_needles: 1
        number_of_threads: 1

      103:
        name: Single Thread Blind Stitch
        number_of_needles: 1
        number_of_threads: 1

      104:
        name: Blindstitch
        number_of_needles: 1
        number_of_threads: 1

      105: null

  Stitch Class 200:
    name: Handstitch

    description: This class of stitch (Types 201 through 205) is formed by hand with one or more
      needle threads and requires that each thread passes through the material as a single line of
      thread. Each stitch is secured by the single line of thread passing in and out of the material
      or the interlooping of the threads with themselves. When more than one thread is used, the
      threads pass through the same perfora- tions in the material.

  Stitch Class 300:
    name: Lock Stitches

    description: This class of stitch (Types 301 through 316) is formed with two or more groups of
      threads and requires the interlacing of the two groups. Loops of the first group are passed
      through the material where they are secured by the thread(s) of the second group to form a
      stitch.

  Stitch Class 400:
    name: Multi-Thread Chain Stitches

    description: This class of stitch (Types 401 through 407) shall be formed with two or more
      groups of threads and requires the interlacing and interlooping of the loops of the two
      groups. Loops of the first group of threads are passed through the material and are secured by
      interlacing and interlooping with loops of the second group to form a stitch.

    stitches:

      401:
        name: Chain Stitch
        number_of_needles: 1
        number_of_threads: 1

        number_of_needles: 2
        number_of_threads: 4
        astm: false

  Stitch Class 500:
    name: Overedge Chain Stitches

    description: This class of stitch (Types 501 through 522) is formed with one or more groups of
      thread, and requires that loops from at least one group of thread shall pass around the edge
      of the material. Loops of one group of thread are passed through the material and are secured
      by interlooping with themselves before succeeding loops are passed through the material, or
      secured by interlooping with loops of one or more interlooped groups of threads before
      succeeding loops of the first group are again passed through the material.

  Stitch Class 600:
    name: Covering Chain Stitches

    description: This class of stitch (Types 601 through 607) is formed with two or more groups of
      threads, and requires that two of the groups cover the raw edges of both surfaces of the
      material. Loops of the first group of thread are passed through loops of the third group
      already cast on the surface of the material and then through the material where they are
      interlooped with loops of the second group of thread on the underside of the material. The one
      exception to this procedure is stitch type 601 where only two groups of thread are used and
      the function of the third group is performed by one of the threads in the first group.
