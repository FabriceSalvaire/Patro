Name: SiroFAST

Description: '

SiroFAST is a set of instruments and test methods for measuring mechanical and dimensional
properties of wool fabrics. These measurements allow the prediction of fabric performance in garment
manufacture and the appearance of the garment during wear. The instruments were developed by the
Australian CSIRO Division of Wool Technology. The system was designed to be relatively inexpensive,
reliable, accurate, robust and simple to operate. A simple method of interpreting the data to
predict fabric performance is an integral port of the system.

Tests:

  SiroFAST-1:
    title: Compression meter
    short_description: A compression meter that measures fabric thickness.
    description: '

    The SiroFAST-I Compression meter thickness is defined as the difference m accurately measures
    fabric 2 2thickness at loads thickness measured at the two loads, and is of 2 g/cm and 100
    g/cm. The surface layer calculated from these measurements.

    The measurements are normally made on the (conditioned) fabric and then repeated after the
    fabric has been relaxed in steam. From these measurements the released thickness and released
    surface layer thickness are obtained.

    Comparison of the original surface thickness and the released surface thickness can be used to
    assess the stability of the finish on the fabric under the conditions of garment manufacture,
    such as pressing and steaming.

  SiroFAST-2:
    title: Bending meter
    short_description: A bending meter that measures the fabric bending length.
    description: '

    This instrument measures fabric bending length using the cantilever bending principle, us
    described in British Standard Method (BS:3356(1961)). From the values of bending length
    obtained, the bending rigidity of the fabric is calculated.

    Bending rigidity is a measure of the stiffness of a fabric and is related to handling in garment
    making.  SiroFAST-2 uses a photocell to detect the leading edge of the sample, which is done by
    eye in some other test methods. The elimination of this source of operator error makes the
    SiroFAST bending meter more reliable and simpler to use than alternative instruments.

  SiroFAST-3:
    title: Extensibility meter
    short_description: An extension meter that measures fabric extensibility.
    # Fixme: a1 -> at ???
    description: '

    The SiroFAST-3 extensibility meter measures the extensibility of a fabric under three different
    loads (5, 20 and 100 Went of width). The loads are chosen to simulate the level of deformation
    the fabric is likely to undergo during garment manufacture. SiroFAST-3 is also used to measure
    the bias extensibility of the fabric (a1 45° to the warp direction) under a low load (5 g/cm
    width). Bias extensibility is not used directly but instead is used to calculate shear
    rigidity. Shear rigidity is one of the principle determinants of the ease, which is a measure of
    the ease with which a fabric can be deformed into a three-dimensional shape.

    Formability is derived from measurements made using SiroFAST-3 in combination with data from
    SiroFAST-2.

    Formability = Bending Rigidity * (Extension (20 g/cm) - Extension (5 g/cm)) / 14.7

  SiroFAST-4:
    title: Dimensional stability test
    short_description: A test procedure for measuring dimensional properties of fabric.
    description: '

    SiroFAST-4 is a test method for measuring the hygral expansion and relaxation shrinkage of
    fabric.  SiroFAST-4 is a modification of the conventional "wet-dry" test and can be completed m
    under two hours. Another advantage of SiroFAST-4 is that the fabric does not require
    conditioning.

    With SiroFAST-4 the fabric is dried in a convection oven at 105°C and its dry dimensions
    measured. The fabric is then relaxed by wetting in water and its wet dimensions measured. Lastly,
    the fabric is dried again at 105°C and its final dry dimensions are measured.
