Needle Type:

  # Universal Intended as an all-purpose needle, preferred for woven fabrics where a sharper needle
  # could ruin the fabric. Similar to a ballpoint needle but tapered to allow the needle to slip
  # through without producing a run.

  # Embroidery These needles come with an extra large eye and a specially shaped scarf to prevent
  # embroidery thread from shredding.

  # Ballpoint Similar to a universal needle but has rounded edges and is not tapered the same
  # way. Intended for closely knit fabrics where the rounded tip will push the weave out of the way
  # rather than cut through it.

  # Jeans/ Denim Intended for tightly woven cottons such as canvas. Has a strong, sharp point and
  # very slender eye.

  # Wing Needle has distinct "wings" on either side of the eye which hold the fabric open. Often
  # used on hems and borders, and for decorative finishing. A larger size needle will leave a larger
  # hole in the final piece of sewn fabric.

  # Leather These have a distinct triangular point to help the needle make a large, clean hole in
  # non-woven materials like vinyl.

  # Metallic Similar to an embroidery needle with a large eye and extra long scarf, but also
  # includes a Teflon coating to the eye so that metallic threads will not shred when used.

  # Quilting Designed with an extra strong shaft and with a tapered point to penetrate multiple
  # layers of woven fabrics without breaking and without shredding either the thread or the fabric
  # being sewn.

  # Serger/ Industrial   These needles can only be used in serger and overlocking machines.

  # Microtex/ Sharps More slender and sharper than the universal needle. Suitable for fine woven
  # fabrics, but also compatible for quilting and appliqué.

  # Stretch These needles are intended for use on fabrics with a significant amount of Spandex or
  # similar fabric content. Rounded tip and specialized scarf and eye to prevent skipping.

  # Topstitching These have exceptionally sharp points and a very large eye to accommodate thick
  # decorative topstitching threads. Very similar to the leather needle.

  # Twin/ Triple Needles set in pairs or in groups of three on a single shaft designed to sew
  # multiple, usually decorative, threads at once. These require specialized machinery to
  # accommodate the extra needles, as well as multiple thread feeds. The twin or triple designation
  # is usually accompanied by another needle type specification such as "stretch" or "denim", etc.

  # Describe the anatomy of a needle

  Tip: null

  Point: Length, shape and size vary according to needle types.

  Eye: The hole through which thread passes. The shape and size of the eye vary according to needle type.

  Groove: The groove cradles and guides thread to the eye. The length and size of the groove
   shoulder vary according to needle type.

  Scarf: The indentation above the eye that allows the bobbin hook to smoothly grab the thread under
    the throat plate to create a stitch. The shape and size of the scarf vary according to needle
    type.

  Blade: Needle size is determined by the blade diameter (i.e., size 75 is .75mm).

  Shoulder: The sloping area transitioning between the shank and blade.

  Shank: Household needles have a flat shank, while commercial and industrial needles have round,
    threaded, notched or other special shanks. Shanks allow perfect positioning of the needle in the
    sewing machine.

  # Size: null

  Butt: The bevelled end allows easy insertion in the needle bar.
