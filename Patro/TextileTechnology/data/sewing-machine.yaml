# Types of Industrial Sewing Machines

# There are four main types of industrial sewing machines. The differentiation between them is based
# on the design of the arm and needle post. These four types are:

# Flatbed: The most common type, these machines resemble traditional sewing machines in that the arm
#   and needle extend to the flat base of the machine. Workers typically use this machine for sewing
#   flat pieces of fabric together.

# Cylinder-bed: These machines feature a narrow, horizontal column as opposed to a flat base. This
#   allows fabric to pass around and under the column. The diameter of the cylinder-bed varies from
#   5 cm to 16 cm. Workers employ the cylinder-bed machine for sewing cylindrical pieces such as
#   cuffs, but it is also useful for bulky items such as saddles and shoes.

# Post-bed: These machines feature bobbins, feed dogs and/or loopers in a vertical column that rises
#   above the flat base of the machine. The height of this column ranges from 10 cm to 45
#   cm. Applications that make access to the sewing area difficult, such as attaching emblems, boot
#   making and glove making utilize the post-bed machine.

# Off-the-arm: The least common group, these machines require workers to feed material along the
#   axis of a horizontal column. The design limits the length of the seam sewn to the length of the
#   column, but is useful for applications such as sleeve and shoulder seams.

# Raised Bed: Raised Bed Machines where the entire machine is mounted on the top of the table Used
#   where you need the garment to drape away from the needle for better handling

# Flat Bed / Fully Submerged Bed
# Semi-Submerged Bed
# Long Arm Flat Bed

# Different industrial sewing machines offer several ways to feed the material. The main types of
# feed mechanisms are:
#
# Drop feed: The feed mechanism lies below the machine's sewing surface. This is probably the most
#   common feed type.
#
#   Drop Feed utilizes a feeder below the plate that raises up through the plate, compresses the
#   fabric against the presser foot to advance the fabric one stitch, then drops below the plate to
#   return to the original position.
#
# Needle feed: The needle itself acts as the feed mechanism, which minimises slippage and allows
#   workers to sew multiple layers of fabric.
#
#   Needle Feed utilizes a feeder below the plate that raises up through the plate, compresses the
#   fabric against the presser foot,in conjunction with the sewing needle which, drops through the
#   fabric, then both move one stitch to advance the fabric.  Then the separate and return to the
#   original position for the next stitch.
#
# Walking foot: The immobile presser foot is replaced with a foot that moves with the feed, which
#   allows easier performance on thick, spongy or cushioned materials.
#
# Puller feed: The machine grips and pulls straight-seemed material as it is sewn and can perform on
#   large, heavy-duty items such as canvas tents.
#
# Manual feed: The feed is controlled entirely by the worker, who can do delicate, personal work such
#   as shoe repair, embroidery and quilting. On industrial sewing machines, it is sometimes necessary
#   to remove the feed dogs to obtain a manual feed.

#  Compound Feed utilizes a feeder below the plate that raises up through the plate, compresses the
#  fabric against the presser foot in conjunction with a feeder above the plate which both pinch the
#  fabric and both move one stitch to advance the fabric together

#  Unison Feed combines Needle Feed with Compound Feed The Needle penetrates the fabric, the top and
#  bottom feed dogs compress on the fabric, and they all advance the fabric one stitch, all release
#  as the presser foot drops to hold the fabric, and all return for the next stitch
#
#  Differential Feed utilizes a two piece feeder below the plate that raises up through the plate,
#  compresses the fabric against the presser foot and then advances the fabric.  The front (main)
#  feeder and rear feeder can be set to move the same or different distances.  When the rear feeder
#  is set to move farther than the front, the fabric is stretched.  When the rear feeder is set to
#  move less than the front, the fabric is gathered (shirring)
#
#  Compound-Differential Feed utilizes a feeder below the plate that raises up through the plate,
#  compresses the fabric against the presser foot in conjunction with a feeder above the plate which
#  both pinch the fabric and both move one stitch to advance the fabric together.  The feeder below
#  the plate is in two parts, front and rear and can either be set to stretch or gather (shirr) the
#  fabric as it feeds.
#
#  Wheel Feed utilizes a roller that advances the fabric one stitch length at a time, in a
#  ratcheting motion. The presser foot has small rollers to permit easy movement.  Wheel feed is
#  used when the material being sewn would be damaged by tooth feeders.  Examples are vinyl plastic
#  and some leather products
#
#  Cup (Wheel) Feed utilizes one or two cup shaped wheels that pinch the edge of the material,
#  permitting the needle to sew across the edge of the material. Often called a "fur machine" as
#  this machine is ideal for sewing the narrow strips together to create a fur coat.
