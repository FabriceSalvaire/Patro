"""This module implements a 2D graphic engine as a scene rendered by a painter class.

A scene contains graphic items like text, image line, circle and BÃ©zier curve.  A painter class is
responsible to render the scene on the screen or a graphic file format.

These painters are available for screen rendering:

* Matplotlib : :mod:`Patro.GraphicEngine.Painter.MplPainter`
* Qt         : :mod:`Patro.GraphicEngine.Painter.QtPainter`

These painters are available for graphic file format:

* DXF   : :mod:`Patro.GraphicEngine.Painter.DxfPainter`
* LaTeX : :mod:`Patro.GraphicEngine.Painter.TexPainter`
* PDF   : :mod:`Patro.GraphicEngine.Painter.PdfPainter`
* SVG   : :mod:`Patro.GraphicEngine.Painter.SvgPainter`
