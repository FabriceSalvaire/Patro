 Introduction
=============

PyValentina is a python implementation of the `Valentina <http://valentina-project.org/>`_ Pattern
Drafting software, which only focus to the core engine and not to the graphical user interface.

A pattern in flat pattern design is build from geometrical operations which can be turned to a
computer program and is thus a field of applications of Computer Aided Design.  It corresponds more
precisely to parametric modelling with dedicated features to fashion modelling and manufacturing.

What is the requirements of a pattern drafting software ?
---------------------------------------------------------

The core functionality of a CAD system for pattern drafting consists of these two software components :

* an _open_ file format to store and exchange the pattern,
* a geometrical engine to compute the pattern, e.g. to generate the layout of each fabric's piece of a clothe.

The XML language is a natural candidate to define an open file format to store and exchange the
pattern. Valentina uses XML to sore measurements in *.vit* files and patterns in *.val* files.

Another solution to define and store a pattern is to use a programming language, it can be a
dedicated language or any programming language associated to a dedicated API.  Many graphical
languages was invented for specific usages, e.g. PostScript for printer, Metafont and MetaPost for
publishing, G-code for machining etc.

Usually the geometrical operations of a pattern are simple in comparison to the requirements of a
mechanical or electronic CAD software.  In first hand it is only 2D and the number of operations
should be handled smoothly by a computer of these days, whereas it is still challenging for other
domains.  A pattern drafting software only need a good geometrical engine to be designed
efficiently.

Finally, a pattern drafting software requires an efficient graphical user interface so as to be used
by fashion designers and not only by computer scientists.  This software component is more challenging in
therms of software engineering, i.e. in therms of design and cost.

Why Python is a good language for this library ?
------------------------------------------------

The Python language has a large audience in engineering, due to its canonical syntax and richness of
its ecosystem (scientific libraries).

Python is a high level language and thus more productive.

Python is used as scripting language to extend many software, in particular the famous open source
3D creation suite `Blender <https://www.blender.org>`_, the parametric 3D modeller `FreeCad
<http://freecadweb.org>`_ as well as the SVG editor `Inkscape <https://inkscape.org/>`_.  Moreover
the 3D human model generator `MakeHuman <http://www.makehuman.org>`_ is written in Python.

Python can be easily extended by C libraries using `CFFI <http://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_
and C++ libraries using `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_.

What is the purpose of this library ?
-------------------------------------

This library could serve several purposes :

* help to experiment core features for pattern drafting,
* plug Valentina to software featuring a Python plugin mechanism like Blender, FreeCad etc.

Could we implement a full software using Python ?
-------------------------------------------------

The answer is *yes we can!* since `Qt <https://www.qt.io>`_ has as a nice binding so called `PyQt
<https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro>`_ (if we consider Qt is superior to GTK and
WxWidgets).

But up to now Python as of course some drawbacks!

Its main drawback is due to the fact the standard interpreter cannot execute more than one *Python
bytecode* thread in true parallelism (multi-core), this limitation so called Global Interpreter Lock
is required for implementation simplicity.  Consequently we can do multi-threading, even on
multi-core in some cases, but less easily than in Java or Cxx11.

Despite a GUI implemented in PyQt is almost of the time more faster than the human perception on a
computer of these days.  It can be sometime difficult to overcome some latency arising from the
software stack.  Thus yes we can do it, but it could requires some tricks to achieve the performance
of a C++ application.
